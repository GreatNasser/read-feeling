## Example Sentiment Analysis

Here is an example Python code snippet used to perform sentiment analysis:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    return blob.sentiment.polarity

# Example usage:
text = "I had a fantastic day today!"
sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment(text)
if sentiment_score > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif sentiment_score < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Neutral")
```

## Example JSON Report:

```json
{
  "date": "2024-10-25",
  "entry": "I had a fantastic day today!",
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "sentiment_score": 0.8
}
```
